# MyStore

It is a front end of an e-commerce website for an imaginary store built using Angular.
It can be combined with the previous project(store front api) as a full stack project.

Auth0 has been implemented into this project so you can make your own username and password or sign in using popular social media or services such as Gmail, Facebook, etc.
To place an order, you must sign in; without signing in you can only put items into the cart. You will give a confirmation after your order has been placed. Please do not enter creadit card information but you have to put minimum requirements for the form to be able to submit.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
